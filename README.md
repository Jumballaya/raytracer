# Toy Raytracer

Based on Peter Shirley's Ray Tracing in One Weekend and Raytracing the Next Week.

## Setting up a scene

You can setup and render a scene 2 ways -- either by importing the headers from `include/raytracer` or by building the binary and running it with your `.scene` file.

### Scene Files

Scene files are simple text files that describe the scene to be rendered. You can find demos in the `.demos` folder.

### C++ API

You can also build scenes with the C++ API, you can find demos of this in the `api.cpp` file.
